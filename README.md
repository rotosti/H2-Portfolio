HTML:
For the HTML I built my structure into 2 core sections, the side navigation and main body.  The side navigation has link functionality to navigate the single page webpage.  The links to the sections have a hover effect to grow and change opacity showing the user that is the selection they are on.  The core of the main section of text is the project section.  This was put into "cards" featuring a picture and information about the project.  The cards have interactivity with a hover and are encapsulated in anchor tags making the entire "card" clickable.

CSS:
The CSS styling approach was to give it a minimalist representation but still sleek and interactive.  I used limited amounts of colors and focused on bringing out the beauty of the Chicago skyline.  The design focus was for the page to be responsive.  The majority of margins and paddings are relative until getting to very small screen widths.  @media queries were used to adjust for screen sizing.  The majority of the @media queries adjust font size, padding, margin.  There are additional properties changes with a navigation bar shift and nav links changing. 

The navigation bar eventually had to get shifted to the top of the screen because the side navigation was not properly reflecting the overall design. Once the screen width became much smaller, the navigation links also needed to get some adjustment.
